# MNIST Prediction

This is a kaggle competition project which is a basic Digit Recognizer. The codes are in the form of python notebook so the results can also be seen. I have implemeneted it using 2 methods.


# 1. RandomForestClassifier
I chose this because it provided me better results as a multiclass classifier. The full code can be seen in the mnist.ipynb. Score (0.94900)

# 2. Basic Neural Network
After using RandomForest, I went on to experiment with a simple neural network which provided me with a better kaggle score. (0.97957) The code is in neural_net_mnist.ipynb
